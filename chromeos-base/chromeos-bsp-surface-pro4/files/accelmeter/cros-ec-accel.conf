description     "Load cros-ec devices and sensors needed by Chrome"
author          "chromium-os-dev@chromium.org"

# This job is used to replay events of devices needed by Chrome,
# in particular accelerometers.
# Given accelerometer needs VPD data, and on some kernel, VPD data is cached
# in the stateful partition, this job has to start after boot-service.
#
# Subsystems listed here must be excluded from udev-trigger.conf to avoid
# replaying twice.

# cros-ec - sensors needed when chrome start. Needed for disabling keyboard in
#       smart keyboard mode.

  # Use attr-match to trigger the iio accelerometer devices.
